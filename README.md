# Programming Basics: Arithmetic Operators
These exercises are aimed at making you familiar with the arithmetic operators.

### Instructions
- **Create a file named `solution.js` and write your code there**
- **Print each of your results to the console**

0. Declare two variables `snackServings` and `guests` and assign them number values.

1. Print the sum of `snackServings` and `guests`.

2. Print the result of subtracting `guests` from `snackServings`. Then, print the result of subtracting `snackServings` from `guests`.

3. Multiply `snackServings` by `guests`. Print the result.

4. Divide `snackServings` by `guests`. Print the result.

5. Declare another variable `drinks` with value `10`. Multiply `snackServings` and `guests`. Then, divide the result by `drinks`. Store the result in a new variable named `resultOne`. Print `resultOne` to the console.

6. Declare two variables: "monkeys" with value 15, and "bananas" with value 9. Divide monkeys by bananas. Print the result.

7. Declare another variable "monkeyfights" with value 20. Add monkeys and bananas, then multiply the result by monkeyfights. Store the result in variable "resultTwo".  Print "resultTwo" to the console.

8. Create a variable named `monkeyBusiness` with value `90`. Increment `monkeyBusiness`.

9. Create a variable named `boredom` with value `13`. Decrement `boredom`.

10. Subtract bananas from monkeys and store this in a new variable "happiness". Add happiness and monkeyfights and print the result.

11. Print the remainder when "resultOne" is divided by "resultTwo" to the console.
